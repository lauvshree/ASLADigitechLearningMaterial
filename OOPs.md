# Object Oriented Programming Language

Object orientation is the premise of Java. The pillars of OOP language is 
1. Data encapsulation
2. Inheritance
3. Over-riding
4. Over-loading
5. Polymorphism

You will be surprised if I say you already have been introduced to first 3. Before we discuss further, you should understand packages and modules in Java. A group of classes which are similar in nature or work together are typically put in a package. For example, we have been creating a lot of examples. Let's put them all in a package called com.myob.examples. The nomenclature for the packages started with the reverse of the website. But not it has become more of a convention. 

Let's now create a new package. Go to File->New->Package. Enter the package name as `com.myob.examples` (or anything you like). This will create a package. Copy all the java files you created into this package. It will ask if you want it to be refactored. Say yes and reorganize.
