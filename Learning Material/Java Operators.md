To make the code more readable, we can include comments/notes in a class; it can be literally anywhere in the class. But ideally we will include it in places where it would make most sense. A one line comment is included with a prefix '//'. A multi-line comment is included with a prefix of '/*' and suffix of '*/'. //This is the first class we created in Javapublic class HelloWorld {/*This is the only method in this class.This method prints Hello World! on the console.*/ public static void main(String[] args) { System.out.println("Hello world!"); }}The compiler ignores the comments and only compiles the actual code and converts it to bytecodes. Try to make changes to the original file you wrote and see if it makes any difference when you run the java application.When comments are written in a particular format, these will help generate documentation for the class files. We will see this more in detail later.
